    <div>
    <p id="p1-about1">To begin with, Html-5 is an updated version of Html and to 
        get the Html-5 we are using today a lot of stuff happened including
        political conflicts and problems between members of certain groups 
        but we'll get into this more later on. This updated version of Html includes
        new feature like the header and footer tags and  also native audio and video
        and the ability to create games and amazing graphics with canvas.

    <h2 class ="second-header-about1">The history of Html-5</h2>
    <p id ="p2-about1">here we have a picture showing the difference between html-4 and html-5</p>
    <img src="images/html2.jpg" id="html2">
    <img src="images/html4.jpg" id ="html3"> 
    <p id ="p3-about1">And In this picture we can see  how html-5 developped inside each group. </p>

    <p id ="p4-about1">Originally the W3C was the first group that was working
        on developping web standards but after a couple of members of the w3c becam agitated
        by the direction being taken with XHTML they decided to create their own group
        called the WHATWG and their goal was to work on the HTML back then. After the remaining W3C
        members saw that XHTML 2.0 had no future they decide to collab with the WHATWG to create another
        group called the HTMLWG  that worked on  developping HTML  to give us what we know today as HTML-5.

    <h3 class="third-header-about1">Canvas</h3>
    <p id="p5-about1" > Canvas for Html is like paint for windows except to use canvas you have to write code and not just click on a color or shape
        and jusr draw.In addition, we can create animations with canvas and i will give you a few examples below.
